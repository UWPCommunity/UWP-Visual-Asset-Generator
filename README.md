## This is a project to develop an easy to use visual asset tool for UWP projects, and eventually Xamarin Android/Forms too.

Immediate goals (2019) are to have the app progress through these stages of capability:
- [x] Accept a base (transparent) image, and then create a single correctly sized and named asset from it.
- [x] Create ALL the assets instead of just one.
- [x] Allow basic margin manipulation as a group for all assets.
- [x] Allow basic margin manipulation on individual assets.
- [x] Support different sampling modes for improved resizing quality.
- [x] Option to save/generate only specific assets.
- [ ] Visual overlays showing the recommended and applied margins for each asset ([Asset guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/app-icons-and-logos))

## Current Status (as of Feb 2020)
