# Launch 2020 assets.

### One paragraph description: 

Create all your UWP app Visual Assets from just one icon file.

### Dev Story
Back at the end of 2019, when we were all getting busy on our Launch 2020 projects, Yair mentioned to me that we should build an app to create all the manifest visual assets for UWP projects.

Visual Studio already has this, but we wanted to allow customization of padding and also differing options for keeping the resized images sharp.

We got to it and are pretty happy with the result!  We collaborated on design and both learned a great deal.

Visual Asset Generator is free, open source and no ads or other monetisation.  

We are extremely pleased to release it as part of Launch 2020.
